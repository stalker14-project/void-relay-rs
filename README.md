## About

This is a Discord Bot for managing Space Station 14, currently in hard development.  
Created specifically for Warhammer 14, but could be easily ported to another server.  

This bot is also designed(currently) to work with [typeauthd](https://github.com/JerryImMouse/typeauthd) SS14 authorization.

## Roadmap
Erghh.. currently there are no such cool roadmap, but I'm planning to implement:

- [X] Whitelist Managing Ability 
- [X] Notes Managing Ability
- [+-] Ban Ability
- [ ] Ping/Call/Summon Player(By its in-game login) in Discord.  
- [ ] Reverse operation to operation above(in-game login by discord).
- [ ] Authorization state, current account that is linked and other stuff I can safely display to end user.   
- [ ] Kick Ability

Also, this bot is going to manage users' in-game achievements, I mean, `100 hours played` on `some cool ss14 job`, so player now can get `super cool discord role`.
